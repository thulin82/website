CImage and `img.php` enables server-side image processing utilizing caching and optimization of the images.

CImage is a collection of PHP classes enabling resizing, scaling and cropping of images. You can process the image and apply effects through filters and post processing utilities.

The script `img.php` is the frontend that takes URL-parameters from the querystring, load a default configuration and then uses CImage to carry out the actual image processing.

Server-side image processing is a most useful tool for any web developer. CImage has, through the script `img.php`, an easy to use interface and is powerful when you integrate it with your website. Using it might decrease the time and effort for managing images and it might improve your workflow for creating and maintaining efficient content for websites.
